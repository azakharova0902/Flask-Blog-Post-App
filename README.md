# Milestone Mini-Project for Practical Python/Flask - CBC

This website was designed as an idea and news sharing hub. Any guest can view all posts in "Our Posts" section (to be further updated with user log-in functionality) as well as explore interesting articles within "Weekly Highlights" page.
A user can sign up by entering a name, email and password to be able to add a new post and update/delete existing posts.

The website is very intuitive which makes its navigation smooth and fast. Information is well structured and stored in logical sections.

# Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. Python
5. Jinja 2
6. Flask
7. Flask-SQLAlchemy

# Features

Our website provides a wide range of features and functionalities including sign-up, log-in (with Flask-login), adding/updating/deleting posts (as per CRUD) and exploring recent highlights (by managing and iterating through json data).

# Features to be implemented later

We will be building up on this project by further implementing features like Flask-login and user session management/security. 

# Test

Our users goals were successfully achieved due to the proper Information Structure and intuitive design. As a visitor, you can smoothly surf our website through an interactive navbar that conveniently highlights the options as you hover over them.
All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination. Moreover, a hover effect has been added for a better user experience.
Th website has been tested accros multiple browsers and deviced to ensure its responsiveness and compatibility.

Our database functionality has been tested with mock data to ensure that proper information gets created is relevant tables within our models.
